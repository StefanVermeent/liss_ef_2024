# Analysis objects

This folder contains all [analysis objects](https://github.com/StefanVermeent/liss_ef_2024/tree/main/analysis_objects), i.e., the outputs of the various data processing scripts.
The analysis objects are loaded by the `manuscript.qmd` and `supplement.qmd` file to fill in the statistics, Tables, and Figures in the manuscript and supplemental materials
